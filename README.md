# PatchedCLRLoader
PatchedCLRLoader is a fork of PatchlessCLRLoader to load .NET assembly and direct the output to mailslot.This is just a practise for me to write some malware . And I have also tried to write my own code with hwbp to test in crowdstrike but do not know why it does not have any output after executing assembly, so I write this(patching) loader to bypass amsi and etw for assembly
<ul>
  <li>RC4 encryption payload</li>
  <li>Patching CLR and ETW bypass via direct Syscalls</li>
</ul>


Since patching AmsiScanBuffer in amsi.dll and Eventwrite in ntdll.dll does not work in new windows defender version (e.g. win11). Therefore, I tried to patch the AmsiScanBuffer in clr.dll and NtTraceEvent instead.

when you are loading assembly ,AmsiScanBuffer will be called in amsi.dll , the AmsiScanBuffer function will then call AmsiScan in clr.dll .

In AmsiScan function, the AV /EDR will only identified the contents as malicious when the global_pAmsiContext is not equal to 0 in AmsiScan function in clr.dll. So we may find the address of the AmsiScanBuffer param in GetProcAddress, and simply patch it to zero or non-exist function buffer. Then, the Amsi can be easily bypassed. 

# Usage

<b>RC4 Encrypt Payload</b>

```
python RC4encrypt.py -i <c# assembly> -o <output> -k <Encryption Key>
```
